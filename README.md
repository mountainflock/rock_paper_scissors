# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is a part of the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum on programming as one of the practical tasks on basic JavaScript concepts. The game is played by a user against the computer. The program keeps track of the score. The game is played round by round, the score is up to 5 points.

The project was carried out in two stages: a [console version](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) was then supplemented with the [UI part](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).
